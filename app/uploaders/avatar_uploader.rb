  # process scale: [200, 300]

  # version :thumb do
  # 画像のリサイズ
  process resize_to_fill: [ 320, 320, "Center" ]

  # Add an allowlist of extensions which are allowed to be uploaded.
  # For images you might use something like this:
  def extension_allowlist
    %w[ jpg jpeg gif png heic webp ]

  # Override the filename of the uploaded files:
  # Avoid using model.id or version_name here, see uploader/store.rb for details.
